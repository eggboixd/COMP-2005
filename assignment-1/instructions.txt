Hello Mr. Hatcher & TA, this is my submission for the 1st assignment of the COMP2005 class, which is the simple game of Pontoon.

I've provided a README.md file for instructions on how to compile and a brief explanation of some of the main features. But I will also explain a little bit in this .txt file.

Here are the steps to compile:
1. Move to the "/pontoon" directory using terminal
2. type in the command "javac Pontoon.java" to compile the program
3. type in the commad "java Pontoon" to run the program
4. The game of pontoon should be up and running

The project can also be accessed through my github at 'https://github.com/eggboixd/COMP-2005/tree/main/assignment-1'.

I hope this is acceptable, if there are any revisions to be made do let me know and I will get back as soon as possible.

Best regards,
